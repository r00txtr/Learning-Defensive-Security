      - *Popular Tools:* CrowdStrike, Carbon Black, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
      - *Practical Exercise:* Deploy an EDR solution in a virtual environment and simulate a malware attack to observe the detection and response.
   - **Encryption:**
      - *Definition:* The process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access.
      - *Key Types:* Symmetric Encryption, Asymmetric Encryption, Data at Rest Encryption, Data in Transit Encryption.
      - *Practical Exercise:* Encrypt files using tools like BitLocker or VeraCrypt and verify their security.
   - **Patch Management:**
      - *Definition:* The process of managing software updates to fix vulnerabilities.
      - *Tools:* WSUS, SCCM, Ansible.
      - *Practical Exercise:* Automate patch deployment for a group of systems using a patch management tool.
